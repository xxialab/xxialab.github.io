      <p>
        We are building a theory and simulation group on soft and bio matter. We welcome curious and motivated students and postdocs who enjoy working at the 
        interface of statistical physics, soft matter, biological physics and computational sciences.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Postdoctoral positions</h2>
      <p>
        We are looking for postdocs with a PhD in physics, chemistry, materials science, or a related area who are interested in soft matter, 
        statistical mechanics, and bio inspired or active systems. The earliest starting date is February 2026. The standard postdoctoral 
        package includes a competitive annual salary, social insurance and housing fund, and support for conference travel and 
        international collaboration. Outstanding candidates will be encouraged to apply for university and provincial fellowship programs that 
        provide additional salary and research support.
      </p>
      <p>
        Postdocs will have the freedom to develop independent ideas within the broad scope of the group, including topics such as nonequilibrium 
        self assembly in multicomponent systems, chemically driven active matter, and machine learning assisted simulation methods.
      </p>
    </section>



      <section>
    <h2>PhD positions</h2>
    <p>
      We are recruiting PhD students to start in September 2026. Applicants should have or expect to obtain a Masters degree in physics, chemistry, 
      materials science, applied or computational mathematics, or related fields. An interest in theoretical and computational work and good scientific English are essential. 
      Experience with programming (for example C++, Python, or molecular simulation packages) will be a strong plus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research topics include but are not limited to DNA programmable colloids and biosensing, regulation in biomolecular condensates, 
      self assembly of two dimensional anisotropic particles, and theory and simulations of polymer networks. New directions 
      driven by the student and aligned with the general themes of the group are very welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admission follows the regulations of the SUSTech Graduate School. For general requirements and procedures, please refer to the official 
      PhD admission information 
      <a href="https://gs.sustech.edu.cn/#/admission/common?current_child_id=86&id=96&article_id=3329" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  <h3 style="color:#c00;">Fast Response PhD scheme</h3>
  <p>
    SUSTech operates a long-term <em>Excellent Candidate Fast Response Scheme</em> for highly competitive applicants from leading domestic or 
    international universities and research institutes. It provides accelerated review and early feedback for exceptional candidates who already 
    demonstrate strong academic preparation and clear research motivation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Applicants are generally expected to have both their bachelor and master degrees from high-level institutions. 
    For overseas direct entry PhD, candidates should normally hold a bachelor’s degree from a globally top-ranked university 
    with excellent academic performance (typically a GPA of 3.5/4.0 or above). 
    Two recommendation letters from associate professors or above are required.
  </p>

  <p>
    More details can be found in the official 2026 announcement 
    <a href="https://gs.sustech.edu.cn/#/admission/detail?current_child_id=86&amp;id=96&amp;article_id=3381" 
       target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Candidates who meet these criteria and are interested in joining the CSLM Lab are strongly encouraged to get in touch early.
